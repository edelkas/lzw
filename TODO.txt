Features:
- MSB (most significant bit packing order)
- Support for "early change"
- Option to disable table reinitialization (stop adding to table once full)
- Deferred clear code (specially for full GIF decoding support)
- Compatibility with UNIX compress/decompress, TIFF, PDF...
- Rich / plain logs

Optimizations:
- Use Trie rather than standard Hash
- Bit packing: If bit size is constant and equal to 8, 16, 32 or 64, use Ruby's default pack/unpack functions, rather than packing bits manually

Development:
- Remember to clean code (delete $codes1, etc)
- Add Rake tests
- Package as gem

Test:
- Custom alphabets (same text using binary vs textual)
- Binary alphabets of weird sizes (very small, equal to power of 2, greater than 256, etc)
